# Paragraphs
In Africa, governments in Uganda, Burkina Faso, Rwanda, and Mozambique have successfully and cost-effectively institutionalized joint planning and budgeting mechanisms across ministries, departments, agencies, and local governments through performance and programme-based budgeting (PPBB), where Uganda's Output Budgeting Tool integrates budget formulation and reporting since 2007 using existing Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) and on-the-job training for phased roll-outs; Burkina Faso piloted PPBB in 1997 with participatory workshops involving civil society and Parliament, leveraging sectoral strategies and donor resources like the African Development Bank for minimal additional costs; Rwanda aligned strategic plans with PPBB structures by 2012, overseen by the National Budget Directorate for seamless MDA and local integration; and Mozambique standardized programmes across all levels since 2008 via the e-SISTAFE system, linking to five-year plans without major overhauls. Enabling factors for their success include strong political ownership (e.g., Uganda's post-2011 parliamentary support), capacity building through training, legal frameworks like organic budget laws, integrated information systems, pilot-based phased implementation, and alignment with existing MTEFs and strategic documents. Similarly, strategic coordination platforms have been established cost-effectively in South Africa via the Minister’s Committee on the Budget and Medium-Term Expenditure Committee (MTEC) process, involving the Presidency's Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, National Treasury, and sector ministries like Health and Education for aligned fiscal frameworks and allocations since the early 2000s; Namibia through joint macro-fiscal projections, budget hearings, and the Ministers’ Committee on the Budget between the National Planning Commission (under the Office of the Prime Minister), Ministry of Finance, and line ministries for integrated recurrent and capital budgeting; and Rwanda's merged Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN) with focal points in sector ministries for unified planning and execution alignment.

## A
I'll search for current information about Uganda's development planning and financing to provide you with well-informed insights.Based on my research and knowledge of development finance and planning frameworks, here are comprehensive responses to your questions:

### How can Uganda's National Planning Priorities be better integrated with Uganda Development Bank and other National Development Bank's financing strategies?

• **Establish Sectoral Alignment Mechanisms**: Create formal coordination bodies that bring together National Planning Authority (NPA), Uganda Development Bank (UDB), and Ministry of Finance representatives to ensure UDB's key sector intervention strategies in Agriculture, Manufacturing, Tourism, infrastructure, human resource capital development, minerals, and oil and gas sectors directly correspond to NDP priorities. For example, quarterly sector-specific planning meetings could ensure tourism financing initiatives support the NDP's economic diversification goals.

• **Implement Programmatic Budget Integration**: Uganda's third National Development Plan (NDPIII) aims to increase average household incomes and improve quality of life and should be directly linked to UDB's lending criteria and portfolio allocation. This means establishing minimum percentage allocations for each NDP strategic area within UDB's annual lending targets, such as dedicating 30% of loans to agriculture value chains that support household income growth.

• **Develop Joint Performance Monitoring Systems**: Create shared key performance indicators (KPIs) that track both planning outcomes and financing effectiveness simultaneously. For instance, measuring not just loan disbursement rates but also their contribution to specific NDP targets like industrial growth or employment creation, enabling real-time course corrections when financing isn't achieving planning objectives.

• **Strengthen Regional and Local Integration**: Enhance coordination between national planning priorities and regional development finance institutions through standardized project appraisal criteria. This could involve developing regional investment platforms where UDB collaborates with East African Development Bank to fund cross-border infrastructure projects that align with Uganda's regional integration objectives under the NDP.

• **Create Innovation Finance Windows**: Establish specialized financing mechanisms within UDB that specifically target emerging priorities identified in national planning cycles, such as digital transformation or climate adaptation. This allows rapid deployment of capital toward new strategic directions without waiting for complete strategic plan revisions.

### What governance and policy tools are most effective in aligning long-term development plans with development financing mechanisms?

• **Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs)**: Uganda's INFF aligns strongly with national priorities and programmes and aims to help Uganda align its development plans, policies and financing with the NDPIII and the SDGs. Effective INFFs create binding linkages between planning documents and financing strategies through mandatory impact assessments that evaluate whether proposed financing supports long-term development objectives. For example, requiring all major development loans to demonstrate measurable contribution to Vision 2040 targets.

• **Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) with Development Finance Integration**: Extend traditional MTEFs to include development finance institution lending plans and private sector financing projections alongside government budgets. This creates a unified view of all development financing over 3-5 year periods, enabling better sequencing of investments and identification of financing gaps. Estonia's integrated approach linking EU structural funds with national planning provides a useful model.

• **Performance-Based Budgeting with Financing Accountability**: Uganda's planning process encompasses the Comprehensive National Development Planning Framework (CNDPF) with 30-year national vision, 10-year national development plan, 5-year national development plans and annual plans and budgets. Link financing institution performance evaluations to achievement of long-term planning targets rather than just financial metrics. This could include board governance reforms requiring development bank CEOs to report annually on contribution to national development outcomes.

• **Development Finance Assessment (DFA) Tools**: Implement systematic assessments that evaluate the full landscape of development financing against planning priorities, identifying misalignments and recommending policy interventions. South Africa's Development Finance Institution Review process demonstrates how regular assessments can improve strategic alignment and eliminate overlapping mandates between multiple development finance institutions.

• **Legislative Integration Mechanisms**: Enact legislation requiring development finance institutions to demonstrate alignment with current national development plans in their strategic planning cycles and major lending decisions. This could include mandatory parliamentary review of development bank strategic plans to ensure consistency with national priorities, similar to frameworks used in countries like Malaysia where development finance strategies require legislative approval.

These approaches require strong political commitment and institutional capacity but can significantly improve the effectiveness of development financing in achieving long-term national objectives.

I'll search for current information about Uganda Development Bank's financing structure and corporate bond markets in Uganda to provide a comprehensive analysis.Based on the available information about Uganda's capital markets and development finance landscape, here is an analysis for your panelist Pam:

**Corporate Bond Issuance Analysis for Uganda Development Bank**

The Government of Uganda could strategically explore enabling Uganda Development Bank to issue corporate bonds as a mechanism for raising long-term development capital, building on the existing regulatory framework established by the Capital Markets Authority. The viability of this approach appears promising given that Uganda Securities Exchange already facilitates corporate bond listings, with successful precedents including Kakira Sugar's USD 30 million medium-term notes and previous listings by major institutions like Standard Chartered Bank Uganda and East African Development Bank. UDB's government backing and strategic focus on key sectors including Agriculture, Manufacturing, Tourism, infrastructure, human resource capital development, minerals, and oil and gas would likely enhance investor confidence and bond marketability. However, significant risks must be addressed, including Uganda's limited domestic institutional investor base, potential currency risk if bonds are denominated in foreign currency, and growing sovereign-bank nexus vulnerabilities within Uganda's financial system that require close vigilance. Additionally, while recent African bond issuances have shown strong investor demand with six times oversubscription rates, UDB would need to establish robust credit ratings, transparent governance structures, and clear revenue generation capabilities to attract institutional investors and ensure successful bond placement in competitive regional markets.

I'll search for information about Uganda's domestic institutional investors, particularly NSSF, and their potential role in development financing.Let me search for more specific information about NSSF's current investment capacity and development project financing.Based on the research findings, here's an analysis for your panelist Pam regarding NSSF financing for UDB projects:

**Harnessing NSSF for Uganda Development Bank Project Financing**

The viability of Uganda Development Bank leveraging domestic sources, particularly the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), appears highly promising given NSSF's substantial and growing financial capacity. NSSF reached UGX 20 trillion in Assets Under Management by March 2024, one and a half years ahead of schedule, with assets growing to UGX 22.13 trillion (US$6.065 billion) by June 2024, demonstrating robust institutional strength and investment appetite. NSSF has explicitly stated its intention to increase investments in domestic development projects, aiming to fill funding voids left by traditional development partners like the World Bank and China, creating a natural alignment with UDB's mandate. The Fund's current portfolio allocation of 78% fixed income, 15% equities, and 7% alternative assets suggests significant capacity to participate in structured development financing instruments. However, this approach faces regulatory constraints as NSSF must balance fiduciary responsibility to members with development objectives, requiring careful structuring to ensure adequate returns and risk management. Additionally, NSSF's ambitious growth target to reach UGX 50 trillion in assets by 2035 indicates strong future capacity, but current concentration in fixed-income investments suggests potential risk aversion that UDB would need to address through robust project due diligence, government guarantees, or blended finance structures that balance NSSF's return requirements with development impact objectives.

### High-Level Action Points for the Development Planning and Strategy Team

To leverage the National Planning Authority's (NPA) mandate in coordinating, harmonizing, and monitoring development planning in Uganda, here are 5 high-level action points for accelerating the Programme Implementation Action Plans (PIAPs) under the Fourth National Development Plan (NDPIV, FY2025/26–2029/30). These focus on alignment with NDPIV's strategic objectives, such as sustainable industrialization, human capital development, and governance, while emphasizing evidence-based, participatory, and results-oriented approaches.

1. **Strengthen Coordination and Stakeholder Engagement**: Prioritize collaborative workshops and consultations with Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs), local governments, private sector, and civil society to align PIAPs with NDPIV programmes (e.g., agro-industrialization and digital transformation). This includes establishing joint working groups to resolve implementation silos and ensure inclusive integration of cross-cutting issues like gender, climate change, and equity.

2. **Enhance Capacity Building and Technical Support**: Develop and roll out targeted training programs for MDAs and local planners on PIAP formulation, costing, and risk management, drawing from NPA's guidelines. Focus on building skills in evidence-based planning, data analysis, and project identification to accelerate execution and address capacity gaps in lagging regions.

3. **Improve Monitoring, Evaluation, and Compliance Mechanisms**: Operationalize robust M&E frameworks with digital tools for real-time tracking of PIAP outcomes, indicators, and budgets. Conduct annual compliance assessments and mid-term reviews to identify bottlenecks, enforce accountability, and adjust strategies for better alignment with NDPIV targets like increasing GDP growth and employment.

4. **Promote Innovative Resource Mobilization and Financing**: Guide MDAs in identifying diverse funding sources, including public-private partnerships, climate finance, and diaspora bonds, to support PIAP activities. Emphasize fiscal realism through Indicative Planning Figures (IPFs) and strategies to enhance local revenue generation, ensuring sustainable financing for key infrastructure and value-addition projects.

5. **Foster Research and Innovation Integration**: Drive the development of a national planning research agenda to inform PIAP updates, incorporating emerging technologies, global frameworks (e.g., SDGs, Agenda 2063), and lessons from NDPIII. Encourage pilot initiatives in innovation-driven sectors to test scalable interventions for inclusive growth and wealth creation.
