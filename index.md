## Examples of Cost-Effective Joint Planning and Budgeting in Africa

### Uganda & Burkina Faso: Programme-Based Budgeting (PPBB)

* Several African countries—including **Uganda** and **Burkina Faso**—implemented **Performance and Programme-Based Budgeting (PPBB)**, integrating planning and budgeting across ministries and local levels ([Cabri][1]).
* In this model, budgets are organized around programmes aligned with national strategies, enabling coherent allocation and performance tracking ([Cabri][1]).

**Cost-effectiveness** stemmed from:

* Utilizing existing **Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs)** as the backbone.
* Embedding PPBB responsibilities into existing structures without creating parallel systems.
* Emphasizing capacity-building and phased roll-out rather than resource-heavy reforms ([Cabri][1]).

### Rwanda: Integrated Planning via MINECOFIN Coordination

* In **Rwanda**, the merger of the Ministry of Finance and Planning into **MINECOFIN** established a unified institutional structure for planning, budgeting, and execution. This structural consolidation improved alignment and resource efficiency ([World Bank][2]).
* The practice includes having **focal points** in each line ministry that coordinate with MINECOFIN—bringing planning officers closer to budgeting, enhancing coordination without duplicating roles ([Cabri][3]).

## Strategic Coordination Platforms

### Rwanda: Merged Ministry & Focal Points

* As above, **Rwanda’s MINECOFIN** exemplifies a centralized, unified approach to planning and budgeting—bridging the gap between strategy (planning) and resources (finance) through structural integration ([World Bank][2]).
* **Focal points** embedded in sector ministries further tighten the coordination loop, enabling seamless information flow and alignment ([Cabri][3]).

### Liberia: Unified Ministry during the Ebola Crisis

* In **Liberia**, during the Ebola crisis, the roles of Minister of Finance and Minister of Planning were **consolidated under a single individual** (Amara Mohamed Konneh). This unification allowed efficient coordination, rapid resource mobilization, and seamless alignment between planning and finance in a crisis context ([Wikipedia][4]).
* Such structural consolidation, backed by presidential support, enabled Liberia to implement its **Economic Stabilization and Recovery Plan** effectively, ensuring planning, budgeting, and execution moved in tandem.

## Enabling Factors for Success

From these examples, the following enabling factors emerge:

| Enabling Factor                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Institutional Integration**              | Merging planning and finance functions into one ministry (e.g., Rwanda’s MINECOFIN) or individual leadership across both domains (e.g., Liberia) eliminates inter-ministerial siloes. |
| **Formal Coordination Mechanisms**         | Establishing focal points in ministries or embedding planning within finance fosters daily alignment without needing entirely new processes.                                          |
| **Programme-Based Budgeting**              | Shifting from line-item to programme-based budgets links expenditure directly to outputs and strategic goals, ensuring funds support national priorities (Uganda, Burkina Faso).      |
| **Use of Existing Frameworks**             | Leveraging MTEFs and decentralized structures helps integrate new systems cost-effectively rather than building new platforms from scratch.                                           |
| **Capacity Building**                      | Targeted training and technical support (Uganda, Burkina Faso, Rwanda) ensure ministries can implement and sustain integrated planning-budgeting reforms ([Cabri][3]).                |
| **Political Leadership & Crisis Momentum** | High-level backing, especially during crises (e.g., Liberia's Ebola response), accelerates reform and aligns stakeholders around urgent, strategic objectives.                        |
